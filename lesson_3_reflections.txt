When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When i want to make the content public.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because i might not want to sometimes pull the data,it makes github more user friendly.
